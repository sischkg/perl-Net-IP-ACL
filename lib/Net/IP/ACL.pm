Quick summary of what the module does.

        address => '172.16.10.0/24',
        name    => 'my network',
        value   => 1,
    );

    my $group_network = new Net::IP::ACL::Entry(
        address    => '172.16.10.0/16',
        name       => 'group network',
        value      => 2,
    );

    my $my_host = new Net::IP::ACL::Entry(
        address    => '172.16.10.101',
        name       => 'my host',
        value      => 0,
    );

    # make ACL.
    my $acl = new Net::IP::ACL;
    $acl->add( $my_network );
    $acl->add( $group_network );
    $acl->add( $my_host );

    $acl->match( '10.0.0.1' );                      # unmatched, return undef.

    my $acl_entry1 = $acl->match( '172.16.230.24' ) # matched $group_network, return $group_network.
    print $acl_entry1->name;                        # "group network"

    my $acl_entry2 = $acl->match( '172.16.10.24' )  # matched $my_network, return $my_network.
    print $acl_entry2->name;                        # "my network"

    my $acl_entry3 = $acl->match( '172.16.10.101' ) # matched $my_host, return $my_host.

=head2 add( $acl_entry )

add acl_entry.

=head2 match( $address )

whether IP address $address is matched or not.
If $address is matched, this method return matched ACLEntry.
If not matched, this method return undef.
